It's almost a joke for me to continue to call this a "Goal A Week". 

Anyways, a little less than a year later, I completed my goal. However, it was really fun for me to think back and remember how much I struggled with jekyll when I first made this goal. In this past year, I have grown as a developer. Instead of going to StackOverflow for every little thing, I instead go to the docs and if that fails the source. I am beginning to be able to understand the architecture of a program as a whole instead of getting lost inside some of it's complexities.

I'm excited to see how I grow in this next year.
