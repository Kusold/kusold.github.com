This week was prettyÂ successful. Maybe I set my goal too low, but I am very pleased with a 0.4 efficiency rating. I had two big projects due this week, so they kept me pretty busy. The one thing that gave me trouble is that before I watched my nightly episode of Dexter on Netflix, I would set RescueTime to pause until the next day. I would often forget to unpause it for a while (Thursday and Friday are prime examples).

This "pause until tomorrow" feature skewed some of my statistics. I know for certain that I spent a lot more than 1.5 hours programming (virtualbox vm). I wish they changed that feature to "pause until 8am." Anyways, enjoy looking at what I did this week.
