After finals, I hopped on a flight to visit my friends that moved to Salt Lake City this year. While I am there, I'm skiing around with them every day. Growing up skiing in Ohio means that in order to challenge myself, I need to ride in the terrain park. However, I am not a huge fan of repeatedly slamming into the Ohio ice when I fall so I don't always push myself very hard.

Now that I am in Utah for a week and I can indulge in my true love of big mountain skiing, I am hoping to push myself to my absolute limit. The goal for the week is to ski lines every day that absolutely terrify me. It isn't an easy goal, but with the week looking like a constant stream of fresh snow, I should be able to charge hard without the consequences being too big. I am riding around with my [GoPro](http://gopro.com/), so once I get back I will try to put together an edit.
