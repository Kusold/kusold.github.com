This was an absolute failure. I opened up iPhoto once and tagged about one video. So now that I know that I failed, the question is why? Part of it is time management. I played a lot of Call of Duty: Black Ops with my roommate this week. That game is so addicting, but not as addicting as [Castle Crashers](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/c/castlecrashersxboxlivearcade/) which I purchased on Saturday. Consequentially, if anyone wants to play contact me via Twitter and I'll give you my Xbox gamertag.

Another reason I feel like I failed is the software that I was using simply did not do what I wanted it to do. I've been tossing around a web app idea for a few days that I will briefly outline here:



	
  * Users upload small home video clips.

	
  * They are presented with a VERY simple UI that allows them to only split their video clips. This could be achieved server side using something similar to the [Transcode ](http://www.transcoding.org/)utility suite.

	
  * They are then able to tag the event, location, and people in the clip, as well as a description of what is happening.

	
  * "Albums" are created based on the tags (such as event, location, or person) with a shareable link.

	
  * Each video has a flash video playback. This will probably be non-HD to save bandwidth costs.

	
  * People can then download the original clips to be used in edits of their own.


This idea roughly came to me this winter when I friend I ski with asked for my footage so he could make an edit. I would really like to implement it, but who knows if I will get around to it.
