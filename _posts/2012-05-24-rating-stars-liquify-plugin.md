When I decided to move my Wordpress blog to Octopress, I couldn't find an Octopress plugin to replace the plugin I used in Wordpress to rank how I did on my goal for the week. So I present to you my first plugin for Octopress, [Rating Stars](https://github.com/Kusold/octopress-liquify-rating).

{% rating 0 %}
{% rating 0.5 %}
{% rating 1 %}
{% rating 1.5 %}
{% rating 2 %}
{% rating 2.5 %}
{% rating 3 %}
{% rating 3.5 %}
{% rating 4 %}
{% rating 4.5 %}
{% rating 5 %}
