This week's goal is to split up the footage I took from spring break using my [GoPro](http://gopro.com/) and tag it properly for archiving. I have about 10+ hours, so this is a pretty daunting task. My hope is that by doing this, the resulting edit I want to put together will be easier to make and contain more interesting clips.

Currently I use iPhoto for my video management. This is not ideal because it doesn't support splitting clips, only trimming them. Also, as the name implies it was meant to be used for photos not videos. Adobe Bridge doesn't tag .mp4 files, so that's a no go. If anyone knows of a better program for home footage archiving, let me know.
