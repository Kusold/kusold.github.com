Note: I ate leftovers a lot of the days for lunch/dinner. I didn't bother including these since I already accounted for the cost. Also, a lot of meals were split with my roommate.

If it weren't for the movie on Saturday, I would have met my mark. Still, with out knowing what I spend in a week, $50 was a good challenge. I found myself saying "no" to a lot of activities. Once you have a tight budget, spending $3 on a beer during the weekday doesn't seem that important. 

Celebrating my friend's birthday on Monday set me back a bit, but you can't put a price on friendship so I'm perfectly happy with the results. This week, I learned how much I spend a week when I am watching my budget. ~$50 seems like a lot for a weekly expense. I really need to watch my budgeting when I am not keeping a close eye on my wallet.
