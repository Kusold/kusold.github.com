I've always been interested in photography. I enjoy looking at people's photos, but when I look at mine I rarely find a photo I like. This week, I will be using my [Point and Shoot ](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10151&catalogId=10551&langId=-1&productId=11033625)camera (no fancy DSLRs here) to take at least three pictures a day. There is no theme for the photos, let's just see what catches my eye.

At the end of the week, I will post one photo from each day. I still am debating if I should post the original photo, or the photo after a little Photoshop magic. I am open to feedback on this, because I see both sides. On one hand, photography is about capturing the moment correctly, but on the other hand this is 2011 and who doesn't touch up their photos?

Anyways, I'll see you on Sunday with the results! Also, I would like to welcome any new readers from Facebook. I started linking my posts there so that my only readers aren't my twitter followers. If you are new to this blog, I post a new goal for the week on either Sunday or Monday. Typically on the following Sunday, I post the results of that week's goal. Rinse and Repeat.
