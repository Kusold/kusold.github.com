      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>

        My first time skiing was at Alpine Valley in Chardon, Ohio. It is a
        tiny little hill with 230 vertical feet, two tow ropes (without any
        handles, just pure rope), a J-Bar, one Quad lift, and one Double lift.
        Despite the size, I grew to love the place. Every Sunday, my parents
        would take my siblings and me for lessons in the morning. The following
        year, my parents gave me my first taste of what "real" skiing was. They
        took me to Seven Springs, PA.  It seemed so big at the time.  You could
        ski what seemed like almost anywhere. It was years later when we were
        driving through Colorado on a family out-west trip, did I realize just
        how small those hills in Pennsylvania were.

      </p>

      <p>

        As I continued to ski, I eventually learned that the best part of
        skiing is riding around with your friends. I joined my elementary
        school's ski club, went on the high school ski trip, and eventually
        joined Ohio State's ski team.  It was on the OSU Ski Team that I made
        some life long friends and memories. Margarita pitcher races at El
        Campisino, Tall Tees &amp; 40s, Mark jumping off a balcony onto a couch
        below, the sound of Alan breaking his femur in Squaw's super pipe, and
        countless other ski trips each filled with countless more shenanigans.

      </p>

        After college, I knew that I couldn't stay away from the mountains.
        Within 6 months, I was packing up a U-Haul and moving to Boulder, CO.
        The first time I stood on the ridge at Loveland, I could see mountains
        in every direction as far as I could see.  I knew that I was where I
        belonged.
