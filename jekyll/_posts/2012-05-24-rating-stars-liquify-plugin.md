When I decided to move my Wordpress blog to Octopress, I couldn't find an Octopress plugin to replace the plugin I used in Wordpress to rank how I did on my goal for the week. So I present to you my first plugin for Octopress, [Rating Stars](https://github.com/Kusold/octopress-liquify-rating).

8/2/2013 Update: I am no longer using this plugin because I switched to default jekyll for the automatic GitHub building.
