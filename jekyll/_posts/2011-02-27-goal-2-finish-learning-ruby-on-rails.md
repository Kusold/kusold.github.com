Last fall, I attended an OSU Ruby Brigade meeting and saw a demo of Ruby on Rails. The speed in which you can develop web applications astounded me. For the past month, I have been slowly working my way through [Ruby on Rails 3: Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/55960) tutorial. Normally I watch a an hour or two of it every week, but this is too slow a pace.

My goal for this week is to finish watching the tutorial and post the end result online.
