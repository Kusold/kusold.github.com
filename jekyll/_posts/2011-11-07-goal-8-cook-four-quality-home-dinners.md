After a long hiatus I am going to try to restart my Goal A Week project. Hopefully I will get back into the rhythm of weekly blogging.

This week's goal is something I have been wanting to try for a while. I am a fan of the tv series Top Chef and love looking at the food porn pictures they show. Then I go shove some ground beef/turkey into the microwave to defrost, and make hamburger helper. Not exactly living the life in terms of food.

This week my goal is to cook four meals from scratch (and eat to leftovers the following day). I have already picked out the recipes for the week, and will be going grocery shopping later today. It's often not that I can't cook, but more of a not feeling like cooking. I am hoping to plate my food we'll and take photos to post in my results.

Dober tek (good eats in Slovenian)!
